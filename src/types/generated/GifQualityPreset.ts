 * Quality preset for GIF encoding.
 *
 * All presets use:
 * - `stats_mode=full`: Global palette optimized across all frames
 * - `diff_mode=rectangle`: Only encodes changed rectangular regions
 * - `+transdiff`: Transparency for unchanged pixels
 *
 * These are ideal for screen recording where colors are consistent
 * and most of the frame stays static between captures.
